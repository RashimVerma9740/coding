Rashim Verma - Portfolio Website

Personal portfolio website built from scratch to showcase my work as a Computer Science student and developer. Clean, responsive design with some neat animations.

 What's This About

This is my personal portfolio site where I show off my projects, skills, and background. Built it to have something professional to share with potential employers and collaborators. The design is modern but not flashy - just clean and functional.

 Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- CSS Grid & Flexbox for layouts
- Vanilla JS for interactions
- No frameworks - kept it simple

 What's Inside

```

# Node.js
npx http-server

 Design Choices

Went with a dark theme because it looks professional and is easier on the eyes. Used gradients sparingly for accents. The animations are subtle - just enough to make it interesting without being distracting.

The particle effect in the hero section was fun to implement. It's just CSS animations with different delays to create the floating effect.

 Customizing

If you want to use this as a template:

- Update the personal info in `index.html`
- Replace `CV.pdf` with your own resume
- Adjust the skills and percentages to match your experience
- Change the colors by modifying the gradient values in CSS
- Update the timeline with your education/experience

 Deployment

Works on any static hosting:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Or just upload to any web server

 Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers. Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

 Notes

Built this over a few weekends while learning more about CSS animations and modern web design. Kept the code simple and readable - no unnecessary complexity.

The responsive design works well on mobile, but desktop is where it really shines. Optimized for fast loading and smooth animations.
